So i have been trying to convert all my avacado seed into a plant because i like gardening. 
after a bunch of trail and error.  i found a simpler solution which works without any rocket science. 

Steps which worked for me:

1. Soak the seed in water for few days so the black skin is wonky and soggy. 
2. remove the black peel and just the white part of the seed. 
3. put in a small container with water exactly half of the seed sinking. 
4. leave it for atleast a month. 
5. it will automatically start growing. 
6. once you see green on the outside growing, 
7. move to a pot with soil. 
8. avacado grow really fast and tall, so cut the tip of the plant to make it grow wider (plant abuse but we are arse)


Enjoy avacado.
