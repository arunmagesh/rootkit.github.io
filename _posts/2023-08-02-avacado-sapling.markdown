So i have been trying to convert all my avacado seed into a plant because i like gardening. 
after a bunch of trail and error.  i found a simple solution which works without any rocket science. 

Step

>> Soak the seed in water for few days so the black skin is wonky and soggy. 
>> remove the black peel and just the white part of the seed. 
>> put in a small container with water exactly half of the seed sinking. 
>> leave it for atleast a month. 
>> it will automatically start growing. 
>> once you see green on the outside growing, 
>> move to a pot with soil. 
>> avacado grow really fast and tall, so cut the tip of the plant to make it grow wider (plant abuse but we are arse)


Enjoy avacado.
