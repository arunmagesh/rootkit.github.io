Welcome to my blog! My name is Arun Magesh, and I'm a security researcher with a passion for embedded systems and tinkering with technology.

I started this blog as a way to share my experiences and insights about the world of embedded security, which encompasses everything from microcontrollers to IoT devices and beyond. But I don't just focus on security - I also love exploring the fun and creative side of hacking. I aim to provide a mix of technical insights, practical tips, and creative ideas for anyone who shares my passion for embedded systems and hacking. Whether you're a professional security researcher, a hobbyist tinkerer, or just someone who enjoys learning about technology, I hope you'll find something here to inspire and inform you.

Thanks for visiting, and happy hacking!
